# multiclipboard
Being able to store multiple items on your clipboard when you copy and paste stuff, currently we only have one space slot for when we copy stuff and paste it is gonna override what we already have. 

If there's error displayed on the terminal eg. Import clipboard module is not found, then install the missing module via the command prompt eg. pip install clipboard
